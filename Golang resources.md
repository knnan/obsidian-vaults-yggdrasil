Here are some resources that have helped me in my journey. Sharing them here in case anyone is looking for study materials. [Disclaimer: These are links/notes collected over 3 years and not necessarily in order of expertise, but I will try my best to order them starting from basic ones and moving to more advanced resources]

-   Firstly - [https://golang.org/](https://golang.org/) and [https://golang.org/doc/](https://golang.org/doc/) .Learn straight from the gophers mouth.
    
-   [https://www.udemy.com/share/1013gw/](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013gw/) - Todd Mcloeds Course which I completed. Lays a strong and solid foundation of the most important golang concepts. I hope hes been updating his course. Highly recommend.
    
    -   Tip: I created a repo while following the course. Helped drill the concepts in. Feel free to use this or or make something similar as your learn.
        
-   [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-go](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-code-in-go) - Useful if you want some clear instructions on system setups, etc.
    
-   [https://exercism.io/tracks/go](https://exercism.io/tracks/go) - A recruiter introduced me to this. This is a cool and free resource to both practice Algo DS and learn important go concepts
    
-   [https://blog.golang.org/](https://blog.golang.org/) - Talk about dedication. Ive never seen such meticulous dedication to a programming languages blog. Some imp links include:
    
    -   [https://blog.golang.org/slices](https://blog.golang.org/slices)
        
    -   [https://blog.golang.org/slices-intro](https://blog.golang.org/slices-intro)
        
    -   [https://blog.golang.org/strings](https://blog.golang.org/strings)

-   [https://dave.cheney.net/](https://dave.cheney.net/) - This is a great GREAT resource, I've come to this blog more times than I can remember. Mostly visited by me - [https://dave.cheney.net/2018/05/29/how-the-go-runtime-implements-maps-efficiently-without-generics#:~:text=The%20classical%20hashmap%20is%20an,drawn%20from%20the%20Go%20implementation](https://dave.cheney.net/2018/05/29/how-the-go-runtime-implements-maps-efficiently-without-generics#:~:text=The%20classical%20hashmap%20is%20an,drawn%20from%20the%20Go%20implementation)).
    
-   [https://research.swtch.com/interfaces](https://research.swtch.com/interfaces)
    
-   [https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/schedule.html) - The BIG one. I tried to follow the MIT Distributed Systems course, although I could only follow through till week 6. This taught me more (and gave more headaches) than any other resources here. If you can follow the course through and back it up with implementations, it will reflect highly on your profile.

    -   u:tmack8080 - " ..an excellent introduction to Go by Microsoft: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/go-first-steps/](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/go-first-steps/) "
        
    -   u:dacjames - "I would also add reading source code of Hashicorp [projects](https://github.com/hashicorp) if you're more of a learn by example kind of person like I am."
        
    -   u:komuW - [https://go101.org/](https://go101.org/) is an underrated resource. It is thorough and well put
        
    -   u:snewmt - I highly recommend joining the Gopher slack

PS: golang is pretty cool to learn, specially if you are interested in application infra, SRE domains. I have a job offer from a FAANG for a purely go related role, so the prospects for the language look good at the moment. All the best fellow go-phers!
